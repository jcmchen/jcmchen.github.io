How can we use single material without processing
to build a structure? Moreover, what is the maximum
solid or void space we can create? This project aims to
use hangers as the only material, trying to utilize the
mechanical properties of hangers and assemble them
into units with new structural characteristics, achieving
different structural purposes efficiently.
