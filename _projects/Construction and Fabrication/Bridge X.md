How do we engage structural thinking in the early design process?
Vector-based Graphic Statics, graph theory and Combinatorial
Equilibrium Modeling were introduced to exploit the potentials of
equilibrium-based modeling in the conceptual design process. This
project aims to design a 20 meters span pedestrian bridge in the
interplay between graph, form, and force diagram.
