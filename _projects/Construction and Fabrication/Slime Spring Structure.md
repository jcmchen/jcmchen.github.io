How can elastic and rigid materials joint together without adhesives or other components? This project uses springs to form a series of multi-dimensional semi-rigid joints, for the elasticity, toughness, and geometry of springs. Connected with bamboo rods, the joints play a crucial role in forming a bending-active structure.
Amazingly, the structure can go back to the ground state automatically after flattening or pushing it due to the elastic potential energy stored inside the system.
