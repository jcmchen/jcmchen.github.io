<i>The goal of this workshop is to design a bridge for a new landscape on
campus under construction.
<br/>

Usually, people go to the bridge is because they want to go over it.
This project aims to make “go on the bridge” as a purpose. It is a
place in the center of the campus for gathering, for people to stay.

Starting with safety and functionality for public use, this bridge
integrates handrails, structures, a bike-friendly facility, and
furniture design philosophy in the design process. The handrail
not only serves as the main structure but the outdoor furniture
that welcomes people to lean on and to sit. The curved and
gradient shapes in elevation and plan responses the landscape,
traffic flow, and activities that happen on-site. Structure details
were designed based on feasibility during the construction
process and prevention of the overturning effect of handrails.
