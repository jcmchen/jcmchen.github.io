<i> “An Analogue Controller for Digital Space”

With MomentCube, we attempted to invent a solution to replace existing
control devices for smart home systems, which are often overly complicated and
aesthetically unpleasing. The initial concept for the MomentCube was rooted in
the following three primary objectives: 
<br/><br/>

1) The invention of a piece of technology that did
not immediately reveal itself through traditional
digital signifiers. <br><br/>
2) The design of a thoughtful analog mechanism
that could control digital functionality. <br><br/>
3) The creation of a product that would forefront and
celebrate tactility and touch.
The tray detects which side the cube is lying on
using hall sensors and magnets. Users can change
the room’s mood to their preset ‘Moment’ by
turning the cube to the respective side, and adjust
the intensity of the mood by rotating the knob.

By creating a model micro-apartment,
wired with multicolored LEDs, servo-controlled
furniture and curtains, and ambient music, we
were able to convey the connection between
the hardware controller and the surrounding
environment without the need for fullscale
replication.
