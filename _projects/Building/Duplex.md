This is a house for a photophile (who loves natural light and needs as much
as possible during the day) and a cook (who loves to make delicious meals to
share with friends at different sized gatherings). They are good friends thus
share most of the public spaces on the first floor.

The operative terms of this project are rotating and layering. Private space is
layered above public space. The difference in heights defines importance and
the size of gatherings in each space. The pinwheel shape is the main circulation
and where skylights were introduced.
