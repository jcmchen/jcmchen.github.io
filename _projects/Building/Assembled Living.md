This is a vertical campus proposal for the renovation of an existing marina dry
stack shed structure located in Alameda, CA. Programs on the ground floor are
open to the public. Programs between the existing shed and the ground floor
are semi-public and reserved for the campus community. Programs above the
shed are private, which are the student housing units. The shifted patterns in
both directions are for the sunlight and natural ventilation.

CLT panels connected with the existing shed truss serve as the main structural
system. Concrete forms the solid foundation and the vierendeel truss was
installed for the long-span area in this design.
