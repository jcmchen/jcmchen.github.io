This project use parametric models to generate a series
of patterns inspired by Phyllotaxis, a common packing
form in nature.
Later, Molecular Dynamics (MD) was introduced to
simulate and gain properties, stress distributions, and
probable fracture modes of composite materials. Hope
to generate data for artificial intelligence models input
and develop various materials in the future.
