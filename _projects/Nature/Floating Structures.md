In the face of rising sea levels, how can private waste of coastal areas be leveraged for public benefit? In the
2019 instruction team, we collected broken bikes from coastal area neighborhoods to build a pedal-powered
boat. The boat serves as a transportation and amusement facility at the Beimen Lagoon Visitor Center in
Southern Taiwan.

In the 2020 instruction team, we try to push the design further by introducing wind
power in our new floating structure. We recycled the 2019 instruction team project
and a student group’s work to build a floating structure powered by a windmill. The
bike components of 2019 became the mechanism, and the floating parts were used
to enhance the stability of the design.
