By learning anatomy, I realize not only
the proportions of the human body
but the scales and proportions in
the built environment. Furthermore,
I observe the motions and wearings
of human beings to catch the rhythm
of life.

<i> Representation 2021, Digital Drawing

Instead of coloring the whole canvas, coloring partially can strengthen the contrast of the overall
composition, solid and void, exterior and interior, positive and negative space. It highlights the parts we
would like to focus on in different drawings. Without brilliant colors or delicate textures, “the white” could
be walls, beams, columns, and even the environment. The blank frames all possibilities.

Using the process and style of techniques such as pencil sketching and watercolor painting is the revival
of hand drawing in the digital age. It presents not only the work but how the author thinks and does it, the
linework and the brushwork. It is the place where thinking and working join together.
