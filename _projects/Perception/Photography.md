Though architecture is a projection of humansâ€™ minds, it has <br>
never been a real departure from nature. The built environment <br>
is a theatrical stage. In it, people should be actors, and at the <br>
same time should be audiences. This series presents some <br>
views about humans, nature, and the built environment.

Through the microscale lens, materiality, space and geometry <br>
were redeicovered, the surface of an object is like a landscape, <br>
a new world of fantasy.
