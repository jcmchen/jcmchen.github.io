This project is an exploration of light and geometry.

Inspired by apertures (openings through which light travels) and puzzles (games
of geometry), this project weaves semi-transparent triangular units together,
creating a translucent curved surface with a unique pattern. The curvatures of
the curved surface dominate the size of each opening on it.

The holes are small enough to create the “pinhole imaging” effect when light
travels from different distances and angles.
