I am passionate about exploring the
intersection of technology and the natural world, and creating designs that promote
sustainability, ecological awareness, social connection, and a deeper understanding
of the world around us. At the same time, I'm deeply interested in human
perceptions and sensations, and how we can create designs that engage all of our
senses to create immersive, unforgettable experiences. My works include
searching, questioning, and reconsidering the impact of technological progress on the built
environment, exploring a more resilient and harmonious future for our living and
nature.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
